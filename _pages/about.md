Some may worry and feel helpless when hearing these numbers. However, with a sense of responsibility and switching our focus towards the capacity of our own will to act accordingly, many can prevent the development of these chronic diseases as well as other detrimental health conditions.  Transitioning to a whole foods, plant-based diet is an exceptional effort whether you are aiming to lower the risk of chronic illnesses, looking to lose a few pounds, and, as many have reported, increase energy levels. 

<h2>What is a whole foods, plant-based diet?</h2>
A WFPB diet means  90% of calories consumed are from plants (grains, nuts, vegetables, and fruit). It does not mean that you are vegetarian or vegan and never eat meat or dairy. Rather, you are proportionately choosing more of your foods from plant sources.
